## Phone Consultation — $125 CAD / session

**Category:** Optional Add-On

**Tagline:** Live phone or video calls are available selectively when interpretation or alignment would materially improve outcomes.

**Note:** All calls are scheduled following intake and review. This ensures the conversation is focused and productive rather than exploratory.

**Details:**
- Duration: 45-minute structured call
- Purpose: Clarification and interpretation only
- Scheduling: Following intake review

### When Live Calls Help

**Complex Interpretation**
When async review surfaced nuances that benefit from live discussion and back-and-forth clarification.

**Alignment Conversations**
When multiple stakeholders need to reach consensus or when direction requires real-time calibration.

**Decision Support**
When you're at a critical decision point and live dialogue would help you move forward with confidence.

### Good Fit
- Async delivery has already happened and you need live clarification
- You have multiple stakeholders who need alignment
- The topic is complex and benefits from real-time dialogue
- You're at a decision point that needs discussion

### Not A Good Fit
- You want to skip intake and jump straight to a call
- Your question can be answered async (consider Micro-Consult)
- You want a general discovery or get-to-know-you call

## Brand Clarity Review — $295 CAD

**Category:** Entry Point

**Details:**
- Deliverable: Annotated PDF (8-10 pages)
- Turnaround: 5-6 business days
- Delivery: Async (no call required)

### What We Cover

**Brand Positioning Clarity**
Who are you for? What do you stand for? I assess whether your positioning is clear, differentiated, and resonant with your target audience.

**Voice & Tone Alignment**
Does your brand sound like you? I evaluate consistency across touchpoints and whether your voice creates the right emotional response.

**Visual & Messaging Inconsistencies**
Where does your brand feel disjointed? I identify gaps between what you say, how you look, and what customers experience.

**Direction & Recommendations**
You'll receive clarity on what's holding your brand back and what to prioritize—whether that's messaging, visuals, or deeper brand work.

### Good Fit
- Your brand feels scattered, inconsistent, or unclear
- You're unsure if your messaging resonates with your audience
- You're considering a rebrand but want clarity first
- You prefer written documentation over live calls
- You're a founder who needs an outside perspective on positioning

### Not A Good Fit
- You need a deeper strategic assessment (consider Strategic Brand Review)
- You want logo design or visual identity work (this is assessment only)
- You don't have an existing brand presence to evaluate
- You need implementation (this is direction, not execution)
